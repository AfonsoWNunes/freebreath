Descrição do problema: 

Following the progression of the COVID-19, the number of infected patients grows in many countries so fast it
doubles every 3 days. Since 20% of them are hospitalized and 5% need admission in an ICU, 
the demand for ventilators is extremely high.

No healthcare system is prepared for such high demand, so the rapid manufacturing of ventilators for hospitals
everywhere is rather urgent. Current ventilator models are complex and costly, and the number of manufacturers 
is limited. Therefore, it is not possible to supply the needed amount in the short-term.
